    "- The debiasing function used is implemented in the `RejectOptionClassification` class.\n",
    "- Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing partitions.\n",
    "- Train classifier on original training data.\n",
    "- Estimate the optimal classification threshold, that maximizes balanced accuracy without fairness constraints.\n",
    "- Estimate the optimal classification threshold, and the critical region boundary (ROC margin) using a validation set for the desired constraint on fairness. The best parameters are those that maximize the classification threshold while satisfying the fairness constraints.\n",
    "- The constraints can be used on the following fairness measures:\n",
    "    * Statistical parity difference on the predictions of the classifier\n",
    "    * Average odds difference for the classifier\n",
    "    * Equal opportunity difference for the classifier\n",
    "- Determine the prediction scores for testing data. Using the estimated optimal classification threshold, compute accuracy and fairness metrics.\n",
    "- Using the determined optimal classification threshold and the ROC margin, adjust the predictions. Report accuracy and fairness metric on the new predictions."
